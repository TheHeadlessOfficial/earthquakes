# Conky Earthquakes
 
A conky (with a script written in Python) that shows the earthquakes, using [seismicportal.eu](https://www.seismicportal.eu/) website.<br>

<br>

## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_eq` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_eq`<br>
Go to /home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/earthquakes/font and install the font.<br>
No modifications to do.
<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky earthquakes as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_eq` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_eq` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
